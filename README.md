## Langchain discovery -- Langchain-Marvin1.ipynb

Langchain-Marvin1.ipynb is the first notebook done one the livestream. 
- I used Vigogne FineTuning of Llama for start. (https://github.com/bofenghuang/vigogne)
- It's a Llama.cpp model
- It's the very first descovery of LangChain on my side
- You can use any other Llama.cpp model
- You need a SERPAPI key to use the search engine
